### Aspiring Front-End Developer

I've been teaching, performing and training Parkour for 11 years. In December 2021 I moved to the United States and found a new passion in Front-End Development.
Since taking my first bootcamp and struggling to center my divs, I have found my way with React and have since created multiple projects that are fun, unique and help me personally.
